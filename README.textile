h1. Thief

h2. Installation

<pre>
  gem install bundler
  bundle install
  rake thief:create_tables
</pre>

h2. Usage

<pre>
  ruby bin/thief
</pre>

h2. Internals

<pre>
  Thief.fetch(:first_name => vorname, :last_name => nachname)
</pre>

Will go through all found ETLs (/thief/../etl.rb) and call the fetch method with the same params.
Each ETL has it's own table for "Persons" (dapi_people) and will store all the information in there

<pre>
  Thief.integrate!
</pre>

Will go through all found Integrators (/thief/../integrator.rb) and call the integrate method.
Each Integrator will convert it's own Person-schema to the integrated schema (Thief::DAPI::Person -> Thief::Person)

That's assignment 2.

<pre>
  Thief::Person.all.each { |person| puts person.name }
</pre>

prints out the stored and integrated people.

You can copy the dapi folder and implement the new ETL, Integrator and Person object for another source
