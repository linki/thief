h2. Installation

<pre>
  gem install bundler
  bundle install
  rake thief:create_tables
</pre>

Download the following file http://toolserver.org/~sk/pd/output_pd_export.zip, rename the file output_pd_export.txt to persondata.txt 
and place it in lib/thief/wikipedia

h2. Usage

<pre>
  bin/thief
  bin/server
</pre>

Then browse to http://localhost:4567

h2. Internals

<pre>
  Thief.fetch
</pre>

Will go through all found enabled ETLs (/thief/../etl.rb) and call the fetch method.
Each ETL has its own table for "Person" objects (dapi_people, dapi_wikipedia) and will store all the information in there

<pre>
  Thief.integrate
</pre>

Will go through all found enabled Integrators (/thief/../integrator.rb) and call the integrate method.
Each Integrator will convert its own Person-schema to the integrated schema (Thief::DAPI::Person -> Thief::Person)

That's assignment 2.

<pre>
  Thief::Person.all.each { |person| puts person.name }
</pre>

prints out the stored and integrated people.

You can copy the dapi folder and implement the new ETL, Integrator and Person object for another source
