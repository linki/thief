h2. Internals

<pre>
  Thief.fetch
</pre>

Will go through all found enabled ETLs (/thief/../etl.rb) and call the fetch method.
Each ETL has its own table for "Person" objects (dapi_people, dapi_wikipedia) and will store all the information in there

<pre>
  Thief.integrate
</pre>

Will go through all found enabled Integrators (/thief/../integrator.rb) and call the integrate method.
Each Integrator will convert its own Person-schema to the integrated schema (Thief::DAPI::Person -> Thief::Person)

That's assignment 2.

<pre>
  Thief::Person.all.each { |person| puts person.name }
</pre>

prints out the stored and integrated people.

You can copy the dapi folder and implement the new ETL, Integrator and Person object for another source

Special download mechanism in Thief::Wikipedia::ETL loads the necessary txt file which contains the person data if the file doesn't exist.

<pre>
  Thief::Wikipedia:ETL.download_file!
</pre>
This method is called by the fetch method if the necessary file containing the person data doesn't exist. It will download the zip file, unzip it and rename and move the contained text file to the
wikipedia directory.
